# Potential field obstacle avoidance

This is a simple simulator that can be used to develop and test concepts for UAV motion planning and reactive navigation algorithms. It been implemented as an interactive Python Jupyter notebook which makes it easy to learn and use. The simulation is focused on high-level motion planning with simplified UAV dynamics. 

### Installation
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib
```
